\value{

function (\code{right_ev}) or the reproductive values for each trait (\code{left_ev}).

\description{
Compute the standardized left and right eigenvectors via iteration
}
\details{
For \code{right_ev}, if the model has already been iterated and has
converged to asymptotic dynamics, then it will just extract the final
population state and return that in a named list. Each element of the list
is a vector with length \code{>= 1} and corresponds each state variable's
portion of the eigenvector.
If the model has been iterated, but has not yet converged to asymptotic dynamics,
\code{right_ev} will try to iterate it further using the final population state
as the starting point. The default number of iterations is 100, and can be
adjusted using the \code{iterations} argument.
If the model hasn't been iterated, then \code{right_ev} will try iterating it
for \code{iterations} number of time steps and check for convergence. In the
latter two cases, if the model still has not converged to asymptotic dynamics,
it will return \code{NA} with a warning.

For \code{left_ev}, the transpose iteration (\emph{sensu} Ellner & Rees 2006,
Appendix A) is worked out based on the \code{state_start} and \code{state_end}
in the model's \code{proto_ipm} object. The model is then iterated for
\code{iterations} times to produce a standardized left eigenvector.
