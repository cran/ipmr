\title{Initialize an IPM}
\usage{
init_ipm(sim_gen, di_dd, det_stoch, kern_param = NULL, has_age = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_gen}{Either \code{"simple"} or \code{"general"}.}

\item{di_dd}{Either \code{"di"} or \code{"dd"}.}

\item{det_stoch}{Either \code{"det"} or \code{"stoch"}. If this is \code{"det"},
then \code{kern_param} is ignored. If \code{"stoch"}, then \code{kern_param}
must be specified.}

\item{kern_param}{If \code{det_stoch = "stoch"}, then this should be either
\code{"kern"} or \code{"param"}.}

\item{has_age}{A logical indicating whether the model has age structure. Default
is \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
An object with classes \code{"proto_ipm"} and a combination of
\code{sim_gen}, \code{di_dd}, \code{det_stoch}, and possibly
\code{kern_param}. If
\code{has_age = TRUE}, then an \code{"age_x_size"} class is also added.
}
\description{
This is always the first step in constructing an IPM with \code{ipmr}.
All you need for this is to know what type of IPM you want to construct - the
rest comes later with \code{define_kernel}, \code{make_ipm}, and associated
helper functions. See Details for complete overview of each option.
}
\details{
Combinations of \code{simple} or \code{general}, \code{dd} or \code{di},
and \code{det} or \code{stoch} are generated to create 1 of 12 unique IPM classes.

Within \code{stoch} model types, there are two additional options:
\code{"kern"} or \code{"param"}. These distinguish between models that
use kernel resampling vs those that use parameter resampling (\emph{sensu} Metcalf et al.
2015). Below are quick definitions. More detailed explanations can be found
in the \code{vignettes("ipmr-introduction", package = 'ipmr')}.

\itemize{

  \item{\code{sim_gen}}
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{simple}}{: an IPM with a single continuous state variable that does not include
    any discrete stages. Simple IPMs can still be stochastic and/or density dependent.}
    \item{\code{general}}{: an IPM with more than one continuous state variable
    and/or a model that includes discrete stages.}
 }
 \item{\code{di_dd}}
 \itemize{
    \item{\code{dd}}{: used to denote a density dependent IPM.}
    \item{\code{di}}{: used to denote a density independent IPM.}
 }
 \item{\code{det_stoch}}
 \itemize{
    \item{\code{det}}{: used to denote a deterministic IPM.}
    \item{\code{stoch}}{: used to denote a stochastic IPM. Stochasticity can
    be implemented in two ways in \code{ipmr}: \code{"kern"} resampling,
    and \code{"param"} resampling.}
 }
 \item{\code{kern_param} - if using \code{det}, this should be omitted. If
 using \code{stoch}, then one of the following: }
 \itemize{
    \item{\code{kern}}{: used to denote an IPM that uses kernel resampling. Briefly,
    these models build all of the iteration kernels ahead of time and then choose one
    at random or in a user-specified order as they move from iteration to iteration. The
    user-specified population vector is multiplied by the chosen kernel and the result
    is multiplied by the next kernel for the desired number of iterations.}
    \item{\code{param}}{: used to denote parameter resampling. This samples distributions
    for each parameter based on user-specified functions supplied to \code{define_env_state()}.
    This will be a bit slower than \code{"kern"} resampling because kernels
    need to be reconstructed from new parameters at every time step.}
